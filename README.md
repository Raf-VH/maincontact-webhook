# Maincontact Webhook

We will create a webhook for Contacts from the Sales Cloud v2. We build upon steps described in the SAP Cloud SDK javascript "Getting Started" Tutorial to create a complete flow. \
We will create a webhook that will automatically changes the `MainContact` field of a Contact, when it becomes a Maincontact of an Account.
